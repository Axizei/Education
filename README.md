Some wisdom for all Ages

## Crash Course

All wisdom is not always wellcome. This was proven locally when a Lady stated that South-Africa did not have it all bad from being an British colony back before Apartheid. The Basic old clasic "Every Cloud has a silver lining". She was judged and The media played dumb. Most of the educated could see past this frennzy, but sadly the educated in South-Africa is very limited in numbers. And the Narative In South-Africa is That she is a rasicst. Not that they know what that means in the context of the USA or Brit English language. In South AFrica we have a different meaning of Rasicst and it veries, wildly, on how educated the individual is. The Lady in question most likely does not know this.
